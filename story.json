    "On a calm evening, a small lantern glowed at the edge of a quiet forest. A traveler paused, listened to the wind, and felt safe enough to take one gentle step forward.",
    "Deeper in the trees, the lantern’s light did not chase the shadows away. It simply made space for courage. The traveler breathed slowly, and the forest seemed to breathe back."
